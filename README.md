🎨 Welcome to Muse App 👋
Muse is a cross-platform mobile application built with Expo, designed to deliver a seamless creative experience. This project was bootstrapped using create-expo-app.

🚀 Getting Started

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
2. Start the App
bash
Copy
Edit
npx expo start
You’ll be prompted with options to launch the app in:

A development build

An Android emulator

An iOS simulator

Expo Go – a quick way to preview your app on a physical device

🗂 Project Structure
Your main development work happens inside the app/ directory, using file-based routing for screens and navigation.

♻️ Reset to a Fresh Project
To start fresh:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run reset-project
This will move the current code into the app-example/ directory and create a blank app/ directory ready for new development.
